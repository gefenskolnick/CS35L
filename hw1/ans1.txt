1. man -k <keyword> for search of keyword in description part of man page of 
the commands. man -K <keyword> for search globally.

2. Use which cp and which wc. which command is used for searching of 
executables. cp locates at /usr/bin/cp, and wc locates at /usr/bin/wc.

3. Use command "echo $PATH" to find locations of executable programs, which 
is /usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin, /u/eng/class/classzfu/perl5/bin, /usr/lib64/
ccache, /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, /usr/X11R6/bin, /u/eng/class/classzfu/bin. 
Then use "find <locations above> -name ? -executable", and X, w, [ are 
found. Use whatis X, whatis w, and whatis [. 
w (1)                - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
[ (1)                - bash built-in commands, see bash(1)
but nothing is shown for X (nothing show in man X, also), which is weird.

4. Use command "readlink /usr/bin/emacs", get "/etc/alternatives/emacs".

5. Use "man chmod". 
g+s: permit group to save
o-x: deny the permission for others to execute

6. find -mtime -20
-mtime is the time of modification, which will be rounded down. -20 means 
less than 20 days after rounding down. Toooooo many files, so i cannot 
display the output.

7. find -type d -mtime -20
-type d specifies to search for directories.

output after searching in home directory:

8. command: "which find", get "/usr/bin/find". command: "find /usr/bin -type l"
There are so many lines, so the last command can be "find /usr/bin -type l | 
nl" to list the index of lines. The total number of symbolic links is 294 in 
/usr/bin.

9. command: cd /usr/bin, first to the specified directory. command: ls -t 
-l, list all regular files, directories and symbolic links in this directory 
in the order of modification time from new to old. Hence, the last file with 
- instead of d or l in the front is the oldest regular file, which is 
"libfreeblpriv3.so".

10. By reading the locale manuel, /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive is the 
usual default locale archive location. /usr/share/i18n/locales is the usual 
default path for locale definition.

11. command: emacs, then command: c-h a sort, which allows us to search for 
keyword in commands. 
Output:
Buffer-menu-sort              M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.
sort-columns                  M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
sort-fields                   M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each
   line.
sort-lines                    M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-numeric-fields           M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.
sort-pages                    M-x ... RET
   Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-paragraphs               M-x ... RET
   Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-regexp-fields            M-x ... RET
   Sort the text in the region region lexicographically.
tabulated-list-col-sort       M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column of the mouse click E.
tabulated-list-sort           M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.

12. command: c-h c-h, to get what options that can be typed after c-h. 
command: c-h b, to find the key translations of key bindings. Then, command: 
c-x o, to move the cursor to the another window.

13. command: c-h k c-g
output:
C-g runs the command keyboard-quit, which is an interactive compiled
Lisp function.

It is bound to C-g.

(keyboard-quit)

Signal a `quit' condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

14. command: c-h f yank
description:
yank is an interactive compiled Lisp function.

It is bound to C-y, <S-insertchar>, <S-insert>, <menu-bar> <edit>
<paste>.

(yank &optional ARG)

Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the
stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.  Put point
at the end, and set mark at the beginning without activating it.
With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning, and mark at end.
With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recent kill.

When this command inserts text into the buffer, it honors the
`yank-handled-properties' and `yank-excluded-properties'
variables, and the `yank-handler' text property.  See
`insert-for-yank-1' for details.

See also the command `yank-pop' (M-y).

15. the dired in emacs (c-x d) shows the "total used in directory 345912 
available 11769808", ls -l does not shows that. And it seems that ls -l does 
not have the enough space to list the entries entirely.
