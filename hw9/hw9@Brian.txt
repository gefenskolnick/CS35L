2.
cd diffutils
checkout v3.0 -b "quote"

3.Install changes
patch -p1 < ../../qupte-3.0-patch.txt
and the output:

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

shows patches are applied successfully.


4&5. Make a ChangeLog
 
I opened git-log.txt to find the original ChangeLog for the original patch.
And then I use "C-x 4 a" to create changeLog for each modified *.c file in the
style of the original ChangeLog. The ChangeLog I made is shown below:

2017-06-04  Jingyue Shen  <classjsh@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

    * src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
    * src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
    (compare_files):
    * src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
    (read_diff):
    * src/dir.c (compare_names):
    * src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
    * src/util.c (finish_output):
    Quote 'like this' instead of `like this' in output.


6.Commit the change

"git commit -aF ChangeLog" to commit. The changes are committed successfully.

7.generate patch

I first use "git log" to see the hash of my commit, which is 
65441cda9c2883f53e1c036361f7162ee18d0a35

Then I use "git format-patch -1 --stdout 65441cda9c2883f53e1c036361f7162ee18d0a35 > formatted-patch.txt" 
to generate the patch.


8. Verification of partner's ChangeLog

Partner's name: Zipeng Fu

I renamed his patch to "mk-formatted-patch.txt". And checkout version 3.0 to partner:
git checkout v3.0 -b partner

And then use 
git am mk-formatted-patch.txt to apply the patch:
Applying: 2017-06-04 Zipeng Fu <classzfu@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

To make the diff, I use:
./bootstrap
patch -p0 < addPatch.diff
./configure
make
make check

Then I ran "diff - ." and "diff --help". It works.


9.Verify my ChangeLog works

I typed "make distdir", and it creates a directory:
diffutils-3.0.1-ae25

I opened the the ChangeLog file in it, and find that the first entry is
my ChangeLog. So it works.

10.Run gitk
I first use
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

Since I've downloaded the X server, I use:
gitk ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs to open the repository.

And I find the newest merge not newer than 2015-1-25 is 
Merge branch 'master' into xwidget 2015-01-25 12:19:27
