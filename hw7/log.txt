1. setup steps

Open the virtual machine software running ubuntu system or directly run the system. Then use the terminal to execute the following commands.
	$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
	

Notice that still the openssh-server needs to be installed.
	$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server

(the password for the ubuntu system user may be needed)
Press Y to continue
Type the dpkg command to confirm the installation
	$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
		openssh-client install
		openssh-server install
		openssh-sftp-server install

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. server steps

first generate the key pairs of the server

	ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh-keygen
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa): (Press Enter directly to save key pairs to the default location)
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): memes
	Enter same passphrase again: memes
	Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
	The key fingerprint is:
	SHA256:iNBnb9ElriP31nIQXFUD2EvyIWCEgvXaNuYMM5r8iN8 ubuntu@ubuntu
	The key's randomart image is:
	+---[RSA 2048]----+
	|    o.  o+o =ooo.|
	|   o ....+ B +  .|
	|  . . +.. = = o  |
	|   . +oo o . o   |
	|    .=o=S .      |
	|  . o O+.o o     |
	|   +   o  + o    |
	|  . +    . o     |
	| ..o E           |
	+----[SHA256]-----+

To get the public key
	$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
To get the private key
	$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa.pub

Add user and the corresponding password. 
(We set the home directory to be mark and the username to be fzp) 
(set the passphrase for username fzp to be memes1)
	$ sudo useradd -d /home/mark -m fzp
	$ sudo passwd
		memes1
		memes1

Change directory to the user directory with homedir_name mark: 
	$ cd /home/mark

Create .ssh directory for new user
	$ sudo mkdir .ssh

Change owenership and permission on .ssh directionary
	$ sudo chown -R fzp .ssh (change ownership. client owner of the file)
	$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Check the server IP address: 
	$ ipconfig
		inet adddress: 10.97.85.46

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. client steps

now use another computer with a different IP address to act as the client

1) generate public and private keys
	$ ssh-keygen

copy the public key to server for keey-based client authentication (instead of password-based one, in which password sent may be compromised)
passphrase 'memes' should be entered
	$ ssh-copy-id -i fzp@10.97.85.46

add private key to authentication agent (ssh-agent)
no prompt for passphrase then after
	$ ssh-add

The overall effect:
	ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh-keygen
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa): ssh-copy-id fzp@10.97.85.46
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): memes1
	Enter same passphrase again: memes1
	Your identification has been saved in ssh-copy-id fzp@10.97.85.46.
	Your public key has been saved in ssh-copy-id fzp@10.97.85.46.pub.
	The key fingerprint is:
	SHA256:EJI5nHka0d49ZiHXEDs42zmH2TfQn+DOYaycTAqbVUQ ubuntu@ubuntu
	The key's randomart image is:
	+---[RSA 2048]----+
	|   .oB.   +E     |
	|    O.o...+...   |
	|     *..o+oo...  |
	|    . ...+**o....|
	|       .S+*oo=o..|
	|        = =o*... |
	|       o . = o   |
	|                 |
	|                 |
	+----[SHA256]-----+

2) SSH to server (user:fzp, pasword:memes1)
	ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh fzp@10.97.85.46
	The authenticity of host '10.97.85.46 (10.97.85.46)' can't be established.
	ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:sgwj06nmfiPIVpMXdyu4c9AWsqywSmlCEI9F1qEY1mA.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
	Warning: Permanently added '10.97.85.46' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
	fzp@10.97.85.46's password: memes1

Run the testing command to show X Window System works correctly, applications like firefox browser is poped up on the client
	$ xterm
	$ firefox

To check whether the firefox process is loaded on server instead of on the client, we can check the process running on the server by typing the following commands on the server
	$ ps -aux | grep firefox
		fzp 28121 12.7 2.8 990876 229780 pts/2 Sl+ 16:06 0:02 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
		ubuntu 28203 0.0 0.0 21296 1028 pts/1 S+ 16:06 0:00 grep --color=auto firefox

To see what user 'fzp' is running
	$ ps -aux | grep fzp
